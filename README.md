# Employee-Management-system-


The Employee Management System is a Java-based project designed to manage employee details, track company assets, and automate salary computation. It demonstrates strong usage of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism, along with core Java features like Collections, Exception Handling, and File I/O operations. The system allows users to store and manage employee records, assign and monitor assets, and calculate salaries with ease, while also ensuring smooth error handling and basic file storage support.

The project is structured into separate Java classes for Employee, Asset, Payroll, and Main, making the code modular and easy to understand. To run the system, clone the repository, navigate to the source folder, compile the Java files, and execute the Main class. This modular approach makes the project beginner-friendly and a great example of applying core Java concepts to solve real-world problems.

In the future, the project can be enhanced by integrating a database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL for persistent storage, adding a Spring Bootâ€“based web UI for better usability, and enabling automated report generation in PDF or Excel formats.
